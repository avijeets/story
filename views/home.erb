<h2>What I Do</h2>
<p>Hi, <a href="http://avijeets.com/">I'm Avijeet Sachdev</a>. I am an <a href="http://github.com/avijeets" rel="external nofollow">iOS and Python software engineer</a>, <a href="http://sachdeveloper.com/">writer</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/avijeets">coffee connoisseur</a>, and high school student.</p>

<p>Now, <em>I'm currently working on <a href="http://github.com/avijeets">side projects</a> while creating a <a href="http://avijeets.com/compsci">Computer Science Club</a> in my school and being a volunteer for <a href="http://coderdojonyc.com/">CoderDojoNYC</a></em>. </p>

<h2>What I've Done</h2>
<p>I previously worked on Tech Charisma (an opinonated technology news website), until I sold it in 2010 (I was 14) when it reached 35,000 monthly readers.  After, a <a href="http://www.unorganizedramblings.com/">friend</a> and I built <a href="http://snazzy.fm">SnazzyFM</a> which exploded upon impact. SnazzyFM was a podcasting network around sports, technology, and gaming. We reached out to nearly 130 countries, transferring 13TB of data, in about 4 months, but had to shut down due to schoolwork and server costs. </p>

<p>Shortly after SnazzyFM was closed, I began an amazing internship at <a href="http://dosomething.org/">DoSomething.org</a>. There, I put my skills to work and was able to work on very challenging problems. 

Since then, I've begun working on programming projects, like an <a href="http://avijeets.com/filmterms/">iPhone app</a> and even an upcoming web application.</p>

<h2>What I Will Do</h2>
<p>In a year, I'll move from my current New Jersey home onto college where I'm accepted. I'm hoping to continue my curiousity and passion for computer programming to a Computer Science major while at school. Wherever I move to for college, I wish to work on cool projects, meet interesting people, and continue to work hard.</p>
